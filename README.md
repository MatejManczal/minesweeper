# minesweeper
From scratch, vanilla js, plain html/css rendition of the ubiquitous game - minesweeper

## Info
Created circa 2020 as a personal project.
Didn't want to mess with this relic of a project at the time of creating this repo and so some layouting bugs remain - doesnt work well on smaller window widths - and I dont intend to fix it

## Features
- Adjustable grid size and difficulty for randomly generated levels
- Live preview based on grid size and difficulty
- Auto clear of safe neighbouring tiles
- Guaranteed safe first click
- Handmade tile set and sounds
- Game timer, displays time in ms after the game is won

## Controls
- CTRL + Left Click to place a flag
- Left Click to reveal a tile
